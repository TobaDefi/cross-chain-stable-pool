# Solidity API

## VaultAdmin

_Bytecode extension for the Vault containing permissioned functions. Complementary to `VaultExtension`,
it has access to the same storage layout as the main vault.

The functions in this contract are not meant to be called directly. They must only be called by the Vault
via delegate calls, so that any state modifications produced by this contract's code will actually target
the main Vault's state.

The storage of this contract is in practice unused._

### _BUFFER_MINIMUM_TOTAL_SUPPLY

```solidity
uint256 _BUFFER_MINIMUM_TOTAL_SUPPLY
```

### onlyVaultDelegateCall

```solidity
modifier onlyVaultDelegateCall()
```

_Functions with this modifier can only be delegate-called by the Vault._

### onlyProtocolFeeController

```solidity
modifier onlyProtocolFeeController()
```

_Functions with this modifier can only be called by the pool creator._

### withValidPercentage

```solidity
modifier withValidPercentage(uint256 aggregatePercentage)
```

_Validate aggregate percentage values._

```solidity
constructor(contract IVault mainVault, uint32 pauseWindowDuration, uint32 bufferPeriodDuration, uint256 minTradeAmount, uint256 minWrapAmount) public
```

### vault

```solidity
function vault() external view returns (contract IVault)

_The main Vault contains the entrypoint and main liquidity operation implementations._

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | contract IVault | vault The address of the main Vault |

### getPauseWindowEndTime

```solidity
function getPauseWindowEndTime() external view returns (uint32)
```

Returns the Vault's pause window end time.

| [0] | uint32 |  |

### getBufferPeriodDuration

```solidity
function getBufferPeriodDuration() external view returns (uint32)

Returns the Vault's buffer period duration.

_This value is immutable. It represents the period during which, if paused, the Vault will remain paused.
This ensures there is time available to address whatever issue caused the Vault to be paused. Balancer
timestamps are 32 bits._

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | uint32 |  |

### getBufferPeriodEndTime

```solidity

### getPoolMinimumTotalSupply

```solidity
function getPoolMinimumTotalSupply() external pure returns (uint256)
```

Get the minimum total supply of pool tokens (BPT) for an initialized pool.

_This prevents pools from being completely drained. When the pool is initialized, this minimum amount of BPT

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | uint256 |  |

### getBufferMinimumTotalSupply

```solidity
function getBufferMinimumTotalSupply() external pure returns (uint256)
```

Get the minimum total supply of an ERC4626 wrapped token buffer in the Vault.

_This prevents buffers from being completely drained. When the buffer is initialized, this minimum number
of shares is added to the shares resulting from the initial deposit. Buffer total supply accounting is internal
to the Vault, as buffers are not tokenized._

### isVaultPaused

```solidity
function isVaultPaused() external view returns (bool)
```

Indicates whether the Vault is paused.

_If the Vault is paused, all non-Recovery Mode state-changing operations on pools will revert. Note that
ERC4626 buffers and the Vault have separate and independent pausing mechanisms. Pausing the Vault does not
also pause buffers (though we anticipate they would likely be paused and unpaused together). Call
`areBuffersPaused` to check the pause state of the buffers._

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | bool |  |

### getVaultPausedState

```solidity
function getVaultPausedState() external view returns (bool, uint32, uint32)

| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | bool |  |
| [1] | uint32 |  |
| [2] | uint32 |  |

### pauseVault

```solidity
function pauseVault() external
```

Pause the Vault: an emergency action which disables all operational state-changing functions on pools.

_This is a permissioned function that will only work during the Pause Window set during deployment.
Note that ERC4626 buffer operations have an independent pause mechanism, which is not affected by pausing
the Vault. Custom routers could still wrap/unwrap using buffers while the Vault is paused, unless buffers
are also paused (with `pauseVaultBuffers`)._

### unpauseVault

```solidity
function unpauseVault() external
```

Reverse a `pause` operation, and restore Vault pool operations to normal functionality.

_This is a permissioned function that will only work on a paused Vault within the Buffer Period set during
deployment. Note that the Vault will automatically unpause after the Buffer Period expires. As noted above,
ERC4626 buffers and Vault operations on pools are independent. Unpausing the Vault does not reverse
`pauseVaultBuffers`. If buffers were also paused, they will remain in that state until explicitly unpaused._

### _setVaultPaused

```solidity
function _setVaultPaused(bool pausing) internal
```

_The contract can only be paused until the end of the Pause Window, and
unpaused until the end of the Buffer Period._

### pausePool

```solidity
function pausePool(address pool) external
```

Pause the Pool: an emergency action which disables all pool functions.

_This is a permissioned function that will only work during the Pause Window set during pool factory
deployment._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pool | address | The pool being paused |

### unpausePool

```solidity
function unpausePool(address pool) external
```

Reverse a `pause` operation, and restore the Pool to normal functionality.

_This is a permissioned function that will only work on a paused Pool within the Buffer Period set during
deployment. Note that the Pool will automatically unpause after the Buffer Period expires._

#### Parameters

| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pool | address | The pool being unpaused |

### _setPoolPaused

```solidity
function _setPoolPaused(address pool, bool pausing) internal
```

### setStaticSwapFeePercentage

```solidity
function setStaticSwapFeePercentage(address pool, uint256 swapFeePercentage) external
```

Assigns a new static swap fee percentage to the specified pool.

_This is a permissioned function, disabled if the pool is paused. The swap fee percentage must be within
the bounds specified by the pool's implementation of `ISwapFeePercentageBounds`.
Emits the SwapFeePercentageChanged event._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pool | address | The address of the pool for which the static swap fee will be changed |
| swapFeePercentage | uint256 | The new swap fee percentage to apply to the pool |

### collectAggregateFees

```solidity
function collectAggregateFees(address pool) public returns (uint256[] totalSwapFees, uint256[] totalYieldFees)

### updateAggregateSwapFeePercentage

```solidity
function updateAggregateSwapFeePercentage(address pool, uint256 newAggregateSwapFeePercentage) external
```

Update an aggregate swap fee percentage.

_Can only be called by the current protocol fee controller. Called when governance overrides a protocol fee
for a specific pool, or to permissionlessly update a pool to a changed global protocol fee value (if the pool's
fee has not previously been set by governance). Ensures the aggregate percentage <= FixedPoint.ONE, and also
that the final value does not lose precision when stored in 24 bits (see `FEE_BITLENGTH` in VaultTypes.sol).
Emits an `AggregateSwapFeePercentageChanged` event._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pool | address | The pool whose swap fee percentage will be updated |
| newAggregateSwapFeePercentage | uint256 | The new aggregate swap fee percentage |

### updateAggregateYieldFeePercentage

```solidity
function updateAggregateYieldFeePercentage(address pool, uint256 newAggregateYieldFeePercentage) external
```

Update an aggregate yield fee percentage.

_Can only be called by the current protocol fee controller. Called when governance overrides a protocol fee
for a specific pool, or to permissionlessly update a pool to a changed global protocol fee value (if the pool's
fee has not previously been set by governance). Ensures the aggregate percentage <= FixedPoint.ONE, and also
that the final value does not lose precision when stored in 24 bits (see `FEE_BITLENGTH` in VaultTypes.sol).
Emits an `AggregateYieldFeePercentageChanged` event._

| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| newProtocolFeeController | contract IProtocolFeeController | The address of the new Protocol Fee Controller |

### enableRecoveryMode

```solidity
function enableRecoveryMode(address pool) external
```

Enable recovery mode for a pool.

_This is a permissioned function. It enables a safe proportional withdrawal, with no external calls.
Since there are no external calls, ensuring that entering Recovery Mode cannot fail, we cannot compute and so
must forfeit any yield fees between the last operation and enabling Recovery Mode. For the same reason, live
balances cannot be updated while in Recovery Mode, as doing so might cause withdrawals to fail._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pool | address | The address of the pool |

### disableRecoveryMode

```solidity
function disableRecoveryMode(address pool) external
```

Disable recovery mode for a pool.

_This is a permissioned function. It re-syncs live balances (which could not be updated during
Recovery Mode), forfeiting any yield fees that accrued while enabled. It makes external calls, and could
potentially fail if there is an issue with any associated Rate Providers._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pool | address | The address of the pool |

### _ensurePoolNotInRecoveryMode

```solidity
function _ensurePoolNotInRecoveryMode(address pool) internal view
```

_Reverts if the pool is in recovery mode._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pool | address | The pool |

### _setPoolRecoveryMode

```solidity
function _setPoolRecoveryMode(address pool, bool recoveryMode) internal
```

_Change the recovery mode state of a pool, and emit an event. Assumes any validation (e.g., whether
the proposed state change is consistent) has already been done._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pool | address | The pool |
| recoveryMode | bool | The desired recovery mode state |

### disableQuery

```solidity
function disableQuery() external
```

Disables query functionality on the Vault. Can only be called by governance.

_The query functions rely on a specific EVM feature to detect static calls. Query operations are exempt from
settlement constraints, so it's critical that no state changes can occur. We retain the ability to disable
queries in the unlikely event that EVM changes violate its assumptions (perhaps on an L2).
This function can be acted upon as an emergency measure in ambiguous contexts where it's not 100% clear whether
disabling queries is completely necessary; queries can still be re-enabled after this call._

### disableQueryPermanently

```solidity
function disableQueryPermanently() external
```

Disables query functionality permanently on the Vault. Can only be called by governance.

_Shall only be used when there is no doubt that queries pose a fundamental threat to the system._

### _disableQuery

```solidity
function _disableQuery() internal
```

### enableQuery

```solidity
function enableQuery() external
```

Enables query functionality on the Vault. Can only be called by governance.

_Only works if queries are not permanently disabled._

### areBuffersPaused

```solidity
function areBuffersPaused() external view returns (bool)
```

Indicates whether the Vault buffers are paused.

_When buffers are paused, all buffer operations (i.e., calls on the Router with `isBuffer` true)
will revert. Pausing buffers is reversible. Note that ERC4626 buffers and the Vault have separate and
independent pausing mechanisms. Pausing the Vault does not also pause buffers (though we anticipate they
would likely be paused and unpaused together). Call `isVaultPaused` to check the pause state of the Vault._

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | bool |  |

### pauseVaultBuffers

```solidity
function pauseVaultBuffers() external
```

Pauses native vault buffers globally.

_When buffers are paused, it's not possible to add liquidity or wrap/unwrap tokens using the Vault's
`erc4626BufferWrapOrUnwrap` primitive. However, it's still possible to remove liquidity. Currently it's not
possible to pause vault buffers individually.

This is a permissioned call, and is reversible (see `unpauseVaultBuffers`). Note that the Vault has a separate
and independent pausing mechanism. It is possible to pause the Vault (i.e. pool operations), without affecting
buffers, and vice versa._

### unpauseVaultBuffers

```solidity
function unpauseVaultBuffers() external
```

Unpauses native vault buffers globally.

_When buffers are paused, it's not possible to add liquidity or wrap/unwrap tokens using the Vault's
`erc4626BufferWrapOrUnwrap` primitive. However, it's still possible to remove liquidity. As noted above,
ERC4626 buffers and Vault operations on pools are independent. Unpausing buffers does not reverse `pauseVault`.
If the Vault was also paused, it will remain in that state until explicitly unpaused.

This is a permissioned call._

### initializeBuffer

```solidity
function initializeBuffer(contract IERC4626 wrappedToken, uint256 amountUnderlyingRaw, uint256 amountWrappedRaw, uint256 minIssuedShares, address sharesOwner) public returns (uint256 issuedShares)

### addLiquidityToBuffer

```solidity
function addLiquidityToBuffer(contract IERC4626 wrappedToken, uint256 maxAmountUnderlyingInRaw, uint256 maxAmountWrappedInRaw, uint256 exactSharesToIssue, address sharesOwner) public returns (uint256 amountUnderlyingRaw, uint256 amountWrappedRaw)

```

### removeLiquidityFromBuffer

```solidity
function removeLiquidityFromBuffer(contract IERC4626 wrappedToken, uint256 sharesToRemove, uint256 minAmountUnderlyingOutRaw, uint256 minAmountWrappedOutRaw) external returns (uint256 removedUnderlyingBalanceRaw, uint256 removedWrappedBalanceRaw)
```

Removes liquidity from an internal ERC4626 buffer in the Vault.

_Only proportional exits are supported, and the sender has to be the owner of the shares.
This function unlocks the Vault just for this operation; it does not work with a Router as an entrypoint.

Pre-conditions:
- The buffer needs to be initialized.
- sharesOwner is the original msg.sender, it needs to be checked in the Router. That's why
  this call is authenticated; only routers approved by the DAO can remove the liquidity of a buffer.
- The buffer needs to have some liquidity and have its asset registered in `_bufferAssets` storage._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| wrappedToken | contract IERC4626 | Address of the wrapped token that implements IERC4626 |
| sharesToRemove | uint256 | Amount of shares to remove from the buffer. Cannot be greater than sharesOwner's total shares. It is expressed in underlying token native decimals |

```

_Internal hook for `removeLiquidityFromBuffer`. Can only be called by the Vault itself via
`removeLiquidityFromBuffer`, which correctly forwards the real sender as the `sharesOwner`.
This function must be reentrant because it calls the nonReentrant function `sendTo`. However,
since `sendTo` is the only function that makes external calls, `removeLiquidityFromBufferHook`
cannot reenter the Vault._
